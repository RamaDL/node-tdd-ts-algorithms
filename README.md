## Simple sorting algorithms

### Selection Sort steps:

1. Find the smallest element in the array and swap it with the first element of the array i.e. a\[0\].
2. The elements left for sorting are n-1. Find the smallest element in the array from index 1 to n-1 i.e. a\[1\] to a\[n-1\] and swap it with a\[1\].
3. Continue this process for all the elements in the array until we get a sorted list.
